## Instructions

  1. Write a method called `roll_call` that takes in an array of dwarves and returns a roll call sheet with their number. This is a roll call sheet for HUMANS so please start counting at 1. For example given the following array:

  ```
  ["Doc","Dopey","Bashful"]
  ```

  return an `string` that looks like this:

  ```
  1. Doc | 2. Dopey | 3. Bashful
  ```

  2. Write the `summon_captain_planet` method. This method should take an `array` of forces. These forces a bit lackluster...let's give them some hart and make them all caps and an exclamation point after to show we really mean it! Return another `array` with a capitalized and exclamation point after. So for example the following `array`:

  ```
  ["earth","wind"]
  ```

  would turn into:

  ```
  ["EARTH!", "WIND!"]
  ```

  3. Write the `long_planeteer_calls` method. The planeteer calls are supposed to be short so let's find out if any of our calls have more than 4 characters. This method takes in a list of planteerCalls and returns the list of planeteer calls that have more then 4 characters. So for example the following `array`:

  ```
  ["earth","wind"]
  ```

  would return:

  ```
  ["earth"]
  ```

  4. Write the `find_the_cheese` method. This method should look through the `array` of `string`s and find the first string that matches one of the following cheese strings: `"cheddar", "gouda", or "cambert"`. It should then return the `string` of the resulting search. If it doesn't find anything, return an empty array.

  5. Write the `calculate_dollar_amount` method. This method should keep help someone keep track of their money. Sadly...people keep their receipts in a weird way. They keep in them in an `list` that looks like this:

  ```
  ["$$", "$", "$$$"]
  ```

  So this method takes a list like that in, and should return another array converted to monetary values. So the previous `list` would turn into this:

  ```
  [2,1,3]
  ```
